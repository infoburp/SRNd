Hooks are a way to get events from SRNd once a message for a specific group has been received.

SRNd currently supports 3 different kinds of hooks:
  1) filesystem hooks which create a new symlink in a specific directory for every new message matching the hook
  2) plugin hooks which load a plugin and then inform this plugin for every new message matching the hook
  3) outfeed hooks which connect to a remote NNTP server and send every new message matching the hook

Hooks are configured with placing a file called $hookname in $SRNd_data_root/config/hooks/$hooktype/.
The name of file defines
  - for filesystem hooks: the name of the directory SRNd will save symlinks to
  - for plugin hooks: the name of the plugin to be loaded
  - for outfeed hooks: the IP and port SRNd tries to connect to

New filesystem and outfeed hooks can be added with sending a SIGHUB signal to SRNd (kill -1 $pidofSRNd).
This will also reload all hook rules for all currently running hooks (including plugin hooks).
For adding new plugin hooks SRNd needs to be restarted.

For more information about the specific hook types read
  - hooks_filesystem.txt
  - hooks_outfeed.txt
  - hooks_plugin.txt

Depending on the goal of the hook the user can
  1) allow everything (*) and may additionally reject specific groups or namespaces (!do.not.want.this.namespace.*)
  2) only allow specific groups or namespaces (want.this.group.only)

Rules have the following syntax and behaviour
  1) each line contains a single rule
  2) empty lines or lines starting with # are ignored
  3) allowed: absolute names like namespace.group.name
  4) allowed: wildcards like namespace.group.* or namesp*
  5) rules can be prepended by ! to reject matching groups like !namespace.group.name or !namesp*
  6) a single * is valid and will match everything
  7) !* is not a valid rule, !some.thing.* is
  8) a hook without any rule will match nothing
  9) whitespaces before or after a rule are not allowed
 10) * is only allowed as last character of a rule
 11) blacklist (!rule) always wins


Some examples:
1) only matches ano.overchan.test but nothing else:
---
ano.overchan.test

2) matches everything in ano.overchan but ano.overchan.test:
---
ano.overchan.*
!ano.overchan.test

3) matches everything:
---
*

4) matches nothing (this is basically only useful for plugins which itself never read messages from SRNd but instead post messages, plugin postman does this for example):
---

5) matches everything but ano.overchan.* and ano.paste:
---
*
!ano.overchan.*
!ano.paste
