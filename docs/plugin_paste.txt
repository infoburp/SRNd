Paste allows to create an (usually) decentralized pastebin based on NNTP articles.

Requires Python pygments library. Debian based distributions may install it via apt-get install python-pygment.


This plugin parses NNTP articles and creates static HTML documents.
Which NNTP articles are parsed depends on the hook configuration in data/config/hooks/plugins/paste, usually all articles belonging to the group ano.paste (see hooks.txt for details).

Paste tries to recognize if the article contains some programming language which it then tries to syntax highlight using the pygments library.
It then creates two files for each article:
  1) a static HTML document created by pygments
  2) a raw .txt file
Both files are saved in a specific directory (usually data/plugins/paste/out/) which can then be served by a webserver like nginx.

New pastes from the webfrontend itself are usually proxied to postman which creates a new NNTP article (see plugin_postman.txt for details).
These new articles are then sent to other NNTP servers using outfeed hooks (see hook_outfeed.txt for details).

For this to work it requires a webserver which can be configured to proxy some requests (/incoming usually) to another server (which in this case is the postman plugin).
A simple nginx site configuration:

server {
  listen 1.2.3.4:80;
  server_name paste.somestrangename.ano;
  root $path_to_srnd/data/plugins/paste/out/;

  client_max_body_size 1M;
  location /incoming {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:53751;
  }
  location / {
    try_files  $uri /index.html;
    expires    1s;
  }
}
