Postman listens on a configured port for POST requests to add new articles to NNTP, based on configured frontends.

Each frontend may be configured to require or overwrite various fields it receives via POST request. Frontends can be configured in data/plugins/postman/frontends.

There are three different kinds of variables:
  - static ones (key=value) which are used directly by postman and have to be set before any of the following
  - lists which are marked by a header enclosed in ()
  - dictionaries (key-value pairs) which are marked by a header enclosed in []

Static variables currently supported:
  - uid_host          will be used as sender part of a new NNTP article (required field in frontend configuration)
  - enforce_target    will overwrite the redirection target postman usually receives via POST request (optional)
  - enforce_board     will overwrite the group postman writes the NNTP article to (optional)

List variables currently supported:
  - (required_fields) will reject the POST if any of the following fields are missing
  - (allowed_files)   will reject the POST if it contains a binary attachment whose content type is not one of the following, wildcards like image/* are supported
  - (allowed_boards)  will reject the POST if its desired board/group field is not in this list

Dictionary variables currently supported:
  - [defaults]        will be used as default for listed variables if the POST request does not contain those or they are empty
