Filesystem hooks will create a symlink in $SRNd_data_root/hooks/$hookname/ for every new article matching the hook rules (see hooks.txt).

The name of a hook file will be the name of the directory which will hold symlinks poiting to articles.
SRNd will create the hook directory in $SRNd_data_root/hooks/$hookname.

External applications may use filesystem hooks to get informed about new articles they "subscribed" to (based on the rules of their hook).
There can be different files in $SRNd_data_root/config/hooks/filesystem/, each representing a single filesystem hook.

Usually external applications will
  1) have their own hook
  2) use the filesystem notify API of their operating system (or need to poll) to get changes of the hook directory
  3) progress articles which will be symlinked automatically by SRNd
  4) delete the symlink, this should obviously not affect the article itself
