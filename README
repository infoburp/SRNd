SRNd - Some Random NNTP daemon

SRNd is an NNTP server implemented in Python, providing a plugin interface and three different kinds of hooks (outfeeds, filesystem and plugin).
It chroots itselfs and then drops privileges.

SRNdIt comes with some plugins:
  - overchan (creates an imageboard styled forum based on NNTP articles in specific groups using static HTML documents, creates thumbnails for posted images)
  - paste (creates a pastebin based on NNTP articles in specifc groups using static HTML documents, uses pygments for detection of programming languages and syntax highlighting)
  - postman (listens on a configured port for POST requests to add new articles to NNTP, based on configured frontends)

Usually these plugins run behind an nginx reverse proxy. For details see docs/plugin_overchan.txt or docs/plugin_paste.

Start SRNd with ./main.pyx
