This frontend is part of a distributed and decentralized chan network called Overchan.
The software driving this frontend is called SRNd (which stands for <b class="sig_label">s</b>ome <b class="sig_label">r</b>andom <b class="sig_label">N</b>NTP <b class="sig_label">d</b>aemon), the chan network uses the NNTP protocol to synchronize messages among different frontends. 

<b>Tripcodes</b>

Due to the fact of being a distributed and decentralized system, tripcodes like in usual centralized implementations do not work. Therefore Overchan provides an alternative to sign messages: NaCl/libsodium generated ed25519 signatures. To use this feature append # and your secret key (32 byte random value, encoded in hex which makes it 64 characters containing 0-9 and a-f) after your name when posting messages. The signature will verify all your supplied input like your message, name, attachment, references, board and date. Messages which can be validated will have 6 characters from the resulting public key (first 3 and last 3) in green appended. A click on this "short key" provides the large unique hex encoded public key which can be used by everybody to verify the author of a message on all frontends. You can create a keypair <a href="/moderate?getkey" target="_blank">here</a>. Keep in mind, the administrator of the frontend you use to post a signed message is theoretically able to read your secret key, administrators of other frontends are not.
Although it is possible to use short trips like nick#somerandomtrip, it is recommend to use the full 64 character secret key. If you use another frontend to post a signed message using your full key the message will show up with the same public key. If you instead use a short trip, every frontend you post to generates a different public key.

<b>Moderation</b>

Moderation works with control messages in a hidden group. Only correctly signed control messages of whitelisted administrators/moderators (or more specifically their public keys) are processed. Every frontend has its own whitelist / access control list of public keys which may be further restricted to single commands. Currently supported commands are "delete" and "delete-attachment" suggestions. Future commands may include a "news-add" and "news-delete" suggestion for the overview page.
As each frontend has its own moderation policy and thus may have different keys for different commands whitelisted, posts may be deleted by one frontend while other frontends still show them.
