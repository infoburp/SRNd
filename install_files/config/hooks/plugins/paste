# see docs/hooks.txt for a detailed description about the hook configuration syntax.

# if SRNd is configured to chroot into its data directory (which is the default and recommend) you can only use paths inside the data directory.
# basically you have three options:
# a) let your webserver access $SRNd_data_directory/plugins/paste/out (recommend), or - if your webserver chroots itself for example -
# b) create a (hard) link in $SRNd_data_directory/plugins/paste/out pointing to a directory which is readable by your webserver and
#    writeable by the user SRNd runs with (usually "news")
# c) link $SRNd_data_directory/plugins/paste/out to a remote server, via sshfs or nfs for example

# this plugin requires the pygments module for python
# FIXME: move this warning to paste.py and check for import error
